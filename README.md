# ARIMA-vs.-ML

This projects looks at the performance of ARIMA, Random Forest regressor and XGBoost regressor on two datasets. It compares the accuracy of their predictions and how well they capture the trends in the data, and highlights when statistical models should be used over machine learning models, and vice versa.

### It is recommended that you read *ARIMA vs ML 1.ipynb* before *ARIMA vs ML 2.ipynb*.

*ARIMA vs ML 1.ipynb* compares these models on a simple dataset, and employs feature engineering on the machine learning models to see how much this improves the quality of their predictions. 

*ARIMA vs ML 2.ipynb* compares these models on a more advanced dataset which includes other features.
